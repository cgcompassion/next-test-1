First attempt at a Next.JS site for Hope Starts Here.

We will use this to develop a pattern for future sites.

Step 1: Implement the site using static content.
Step 2: Leverage the CMS solution to make the content dynamic.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

More fun commands!

```bash
bun storybook
bun test
bun lint
```

To Investigate:

- Ideal Github Workflows
- Implement Backstage or other catalog solution
- Get playwright to work with Bun for e2e tests.
