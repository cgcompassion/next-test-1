          Hope Starts Here Online is free to host and attend. It is self-paced
          but takes most small groups approximately 45 minutes to complete. It
          can be streamed online or downloaded to your own device to make it as
          easy and accessible as possible. And we&apos;ll send you guides and
          resources to help plan your event â€” along with profiles of unsponsored
          children to give your small group an opportunity to sponsor in
          response to what they&apos;ve experienced.
